In web development the HTTP is stateless meaning that each request from a client to a server is independent and does not retain any memory requests of past requests . This is now where seesions annd cooies come in place to act as a temporary storage for those requests .
A session is a data structure that stores users information .The session will be active as long as you continue to intreract with the server .This is called a cookie based authentication .

Summary of why sessions are needed :-

a)User Identification - A session is important in user identofication as it enables the server identify individual users by assigning a unique session identifier usually in the form of cookies.

b)Data Persitence -It allows the persistance of users data across multiple requests .This means that information such as user prefernces ,login status ,shopping cart can be stored in the server and accesed as needed throughout the users interaction with the website .

c)State Management- Help manange the state of users interaction with a website . By maintaing session data on the server , where users are in multistep processes.

d)Security -Sessions can enhance security by storing senstive information on the server rather than exposing it to the client side .An example sessions are used for user authentication are less vulnerable to attacks such as cross-site scripting or cross-site forgery compared to storing authentication tokens in the client side cookies .

e)Personlization- Sessions enable personlised user experience by allowing websites to tailor content ,recommendations,and features based on user prefernces and behaviour tracked multiple requests .
